Welcome to python-textops documentation !
=========================================

| python-textops provides many text operations at string level, list level or whole text level.
| These operations can be chained with a 'dotted' or 'piped' notation.
| Chained operations are stored into a single lazy object, they will be executed only when an input text will be provided.
