|
| `python-textops <http://python-textops.readthedocs.org>`_ provides many text operations at string level, list level or whole text level.
| These operations can be chained with a 'dotted' or 'piped' notation.
| Chained operations are stored into a single lazy object, they will be executed only when an input text will be provided.

python-textops is used into some other projects like `python-nagios-helpers <http://python-nagios-helpers.readthedocs.org>`_
